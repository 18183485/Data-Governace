# Data-Governace
**CHAPTER 1**
**DATA GOVERNANCE**
Data Governance is all about managing data well, but data governance is not restricted to only data management. Data governance is focussed on roles and responsibilities , policies, definitions, metrics and lifecycle of data.

**DATA MANAGEMENT**
Data Management technical implementation of data governance. For example, database, database warehouse and lakes, Application programming interfaces (APIs), analytics software, encryption, data crunching, and architectural design and implementation are all data management features and functions.

**INFORMATION GOVERNANCE**
Information Governance is entirely concerned with the meaning of the data and it's relationship in terms of outcomes and value to organizations, customers and other stakeholders.

**STEPS FOR CREATING DATA GOVERNANCE**
1. Defining the vision, goals, and benefits.
2. Analyzing the current state of data governance and management.
3. Develop proposal based on first two steps.
4. Leadership approval.
5. Design and develop the program.
6. Implement program.
7. Monitor and measure performance.
8. Maintain program.

**DATA GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK**
Leardership and Strategy: Ensuring senior leadership support and aligning data governance efforts with the vision, mission and strategy of the organization.

Roles and Responsibilities: Identifying and empowering the right team members with the responsibilities for data governance program and other with accountability for data.

Policies, Processes and Standards: Developing and enforcing the policies, processes and standards for governing and managing data.

Metrics: Measuring and reporting on the perfomance of the data governance program and the broader outcomes of data management activities.

Tools: Deploying and utilizing a range of software based tools to support data governance and management.

Communication and Collabotaion: Adopting specific methods for high-perfomance communications and collaboration in support of data governance and management.

**DATA CULTURE**
Data Culture is how your organization values data and manages and uses it.


**CHAPTER 2**
**DATA TO INSIGHT**

Data >> Information >> Knowledge >> Wisdom >> Insight

Data: Single or multiples units of something. On their own largely meaningless

Information: Data put into context giving it meaning.

Knowledge: Information coupled with experience and practical application. It can be actionable.

Wisdom: Knowledge combined with reasoning, and a context to enable relevant application.

Insight: Product of either or both knowledge and wisdom that enables us to see things differently.

**Data Ownership**
Data ownership describes the rights a person, team, or organization has over one or more data sets.

**Data Architecture**
Data architecture is a direct reflection of data governance. An established and functioning data architecture immediately signals that an organization values data, manages it as a critical business asset, and has controls in place to ensure that it aligns with business needs.

**LIFECYCLE OF DATA**
1. Creation
2. Storage
3. Usage
4. Archival
5. Destruction

**BIG DATA**
1. Velocity is the speed at which the data is created and how fast it moves
2. Volume is the amount of data qualifying as big data
3. Value is the value the data provides
4. Variety is the diversity that exists in the types of data
5. Veracity is the data's quality and accuracy

**CHAPTER 3**
**ROLES OF DATA**

Operations
Strategy
Decision-Making
Measuring
Monitoring
Insight Management
Reporting

**DATA ANALYTICS**
**STEPS IN DATA ANALYSIS**

Data mining >> Data cleansing >> Statistical analysis >> Data presentation

Data Mining: Identifying and extracting relevant data from data from data source.

Data Cleansing: Sizable effort including removing errors and duplicate data in preparation for analysis.

Statistical Analysis: Using statistical methods and artificial intelligence to interpret results and develop insights.

Data Presentation: Communicating results using a variety of techniques including visualization and data storytelling.

**FOUR TYPES OF DATA ANALYTICS**
-Descriptive (What happened?)
-Diagnostics (Why did it happen?)
-Predictive (What may happen?)
-Prescriptive (What should we do?)

Good data management provides the opportunity for significantly enhanced organizational performance.

**The success of governing data can be reduced to three essential factors:**

-People: In governing data, people are the subject matter experts, they are responsible for quality, and they oversee and manage all related processes and responsibilities.

-Policies: A set of adopted rules by an organization that apply to the handling of data specific condition and for particular desired outcomes.

-Metrics: In developing in support of data governance, you hav to consider how each is measured.

**CHAPTER 4**
**DATA CATALOGS**

A data catalog delivers a comprehensive inventory that provides an enterprise view of all data. This view provides essential insight that helps with leveraging data value and provides a robust tool to assist with data governance. 

BENEFITS OF DATA CATALOGS
-Finding data
-Understanding data
-Making data more useful

DATA CATALOG CONTAIN THREE TYPE OF METADATA
-Technical Metadata
-Business Metadata
-Operational Metadata

**DATA-DRIVEN DECISION MAKING**

**6 STEP PROCESS TO DATA-DRIVEN DECISION-MAKING**
-Define the objectives
-Identify the data
-Prepare the data
-Analyze the data
-Determine the findings
-Take Action

The purpose of of any type of strategy is to agree on a set of guiding principles that inform decision-making in support of a desired outcome.

**CREATING A DATA STRATEGY**

-Data Maturity: Evaluate the organization's existing use of data, skills, and data quality. Consider basic data standards, security policies, and data cleansing processes to avoid errors in results.

-Industry and Size: Prioritize data strategies based on industry regulations and the organization's size. Different industries may emphasize data security and quality over data insights and market initiatives.

-Identify: Clearly define and describe data, including file name, format, and metadata.

-Store: Design capabilities for hosting, sharing, accessing, and processing data.

-Provision: Establish processes for sharing, reusing, and accessing data, along with access guidelines.

-Process: Transform raw data through cleansing, standardization, and integration processes.

-Govern: Institute processes to manage and communicate data policies for internal data use.

**Data Strategy Components:**

-Alignment with Business: Ensure the data strategy supports and advances the organization's overall goals, evolving in sync with changing business strategies.

-Roles and Responsibilities: Document roles and responsibilities for data consumers, IT staff, data scientists, data stewards, and management to ensure effective execution of the data strategy.

-Data Architecture: Define processes, systems, and applications supporting data storage, analysis, data cataloging, data warehouse, data pipelines, and ETL functions.

-Data Management: Implement processes, procedures, policies, skills, and tools to manage the full data lifecycle, including security, privacy, quality, metadata, integration, master data management, and analytics.

-Data Governance and Management: Establish rules for data use through data governance and ensure compliance with these rules through data management processes, tools, and staff.

-Evolution of Data Strategy: Recognize that a data strategy may need to evolve over time. Keep data management and data governance updated in parallel to avoid problems arising from inconsistencies with the data strategy.
